<p>While I very much enjoyed my Samsung smartwatch while I had my S5, I now have an HTC M8. It&rsquo;s kind of depressing to think I spent all that money on it and I&rsquo;ll never get to use it again.</p>

<p>Good thing I&rsquo;m spoiled and I got a Pebble Steel as a Christmas gift. Now taking ideas for pebble.js apps!</p>
