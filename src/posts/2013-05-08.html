<h6>[ Another from the KCDC series&hellip; ] I recently went to the <a href="http://kcdc.info">Kansas City Developer&rsquo;s Conference</a> where I like to think I learned a lot and I&rsquo;d like to share some with you.</h6>
<p>Topics discussed included Technical Debt - the gap between perfect and messy code.</p>
<h2>What I found most interesting:</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re going to have debt (stuff you know is wrong, but it works). The key is to manage it wisely. Document it and update it regularly. Estimate how long it will take to fix and re-estimate when updating. Have a plan to actually &ldquo;pay off&rdquo; the debt and stick to it!</p>
