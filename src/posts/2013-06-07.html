intro: 'I decided it was time to learn a PHP framework.'

<p>I decided it was time to learn a PHP framework. After much research, I decided that <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org" target="_blank">Symphony</a> was going to challenge me the most. It is the farthest cry from anything I know and am currently comfortable with. Also, very powerful.</p>

<p>The concepts were so foreign to me that I couldn’t seem to figure out how I was going to get anything done. So, I decided to step back. Enter Cake (both literally and figuratively - I needed some comfort food after failing miserably).</p>

<p><a href="http://cakephp.org" target="_blank">CakePHP</a> boasted a simple setup, and most importantly, quick web apps from the ground up. After messing with Symfony so much, I decided that I didn’t care if Cake worked locally, I wasn’t going to be satisfied until it ran on my linux server, so that’s where I built and tested it.</p>

<p>Granted, I was probably just &ldquo;getting the hang&rdquo; of the whole frameworks thing, but in less than a day, I had setup and run through an entire Cake blog tutorial. I already had a blog and was looking to see what all I could do with it, so I started building a game that my cousin, Chris, and I had chatted about once or twice.</p>

<p>After working with the game and CakePHP for a couple of months, I returned to the blog tutorial and transformed my own blog into a CakePHP-run masterpiece, per sé. So, some little things have changed, but here we go&hellip;</p>
