<p>Most of my friends know that although I&rsquo;ve owned Macs (including iMacs) for years, I have a particular passion for hating on iTunes-driven iProducts.</p>
<p>I got my first iMac in 2005 - I still have it, in fact. Works great, just isn&rsquo;t updated with the most current anything. I eventually sprung for a small MacBook in 2007. It came with Leopard.</p>
<h4>Then, Snow Leopard came out.</h4>
<p>Look, I really don&rsquo;t have anything against Snow Leopard itself. My problem is with Apple. As soon as Apple realized how profitable iPods were and that in general the public needed a new smartphone to change the world, Macs (and OS X) have just gotten the shaft.</p>
<p>In 2009, I got the [then brand, spankin&rsquo; new] 27-inch aluminum iMac. Man, I loved that thing. But continuously, Apple just gave the computer-users the shaft. They couldn&rsquo;t even take the time to do a new, full release of their OS each year. I&rsquo;m not even saying they need a new release every year. Do it every other year - no one would care if you didn&rsquo;t make us pay for each half-OS-upgrade-thing. These people used to be proud Mac users with little apple bumper stickers on everything. Now they&rsquo;re zombies, buying every version of every iThing you can crank out.</p>
<p>Eventually, I sold my iMac. I was one of the first to buy the first iPad - then I sold it, too. It was time for me to get a new phone and I got an android and I loved it. So I used the money from the iPad and I got a Xoom, which I also love. My girlfriend has both an iPad and an iPhone, so unfortunately, I have to continue to deal with iTunes, but I couldn&rsquo;t be happier to be free of iTunes on my new MacBook Pro.</p>
<h4>One last plea&hellip;</h4>
<p>Apple, can you please (PLEASE!) spend more time on what&rsquo;s been your flagship for years - your computers. I know you&rsquo;re not Apple Computers, Inc. anymore, but can&rsquo;t we just pretend iTunes doesn&rsquo;t suck every cent I have? Now, what to do about this pesky App Store&hellip;</p>
