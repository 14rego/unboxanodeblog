<p>This is one of the hardest things for me as a developer. I know there are others who are the same as me, but I also know that it&rsquo;s not always the &ldquo;right&rdquo; thing to do.</p>
<p>This is how it usually plays out: first, I have a need. I need a plug-in. I need a library. I need X. I need Y. Then, I go out and find someone who&rsquo;s already solved this problem. Ninety-nine percent of the time, someone has already solved this very problem. But here&rsquo;s my downfall: it&rsquo;s not good enough.</p>
<p>I like it OK and it&rsquo;s good enough for now, but later I&rsquo;m going to come back and &ldquo;hack the crap out of this&rdquo; and make it better and mine. Or, at least mine. =o) Some day I&rsquo;ll make it better, too.</p>
<p>Want to know a secret? &hellip; *whispers* &hellip; I designed my own PHP MVC framework. Shhhh&hellip;</p>
