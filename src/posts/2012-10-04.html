<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/4444272940" target="_blank">this event</a> tonight - it&rsquo;s been so long since I was out and nerdy at the same time.</p>

<p>/edit/ Well, it was cool, but it wasn&rsquo;t what I expected. I&rsquo;m not real sure what it is that I expected, so I guess I&rsquo;ll give it the benefit of the doubt - it was a good learning experience. However, I&rsquo;m more frustrated than ever about the browser differences and the availability of HTML5.</p>

<p>Adobe has amazing and creative CSS3 [webkit] filters, blends and transforms well on the way. And, of course, all the tools you need to implement your code, easily and quickly. I&rsquo;m, personally, seriously considering Adobe&rsquo;s Creative Cloud Services instead of upgrading my Creative Suite ever again. They&rsquo;ve really thought about what their users need and like and have truly wrapped it up into a nifty package. Also, I had to leave after the first hour, but I bet it was spectacular.</p>

<p>The coolest thing they told me about, although I haven&rsquo;t looked into it yet, is an HTML- and CSS-driven coding app called Brackets, which you can <a href="http://github.com/adobe/brackets" target="_blank">fork on GitHub</a> and customize to your liking. I&rsquo;ll be trying that <em>very soon</em>.</p>
