<p>You may think that this clever rant has to do with my insatiable need to control your cutlery choices, but, in fact, it serves as a witty metaphor: stop using WordPress to build your website!</p>

<p>There, I said it. Also: <em>please</em>. If the sole purpose of your website is a blog &mdash; by all means! Hook yourself up with a Wordpress guru and away you go. You can have a blog, an About Me, and a Contact Me if you want. But please, please, please stop building your multilingual, multi-functional, e-commerce monster of a site with Wordpress. <em>You’re handing your web developer a half dozen t-bone steaks and a butter knife&hellip; &ldquo;Have at it.&rdquo;</em> You’re simply setting us up to fail. There are better tools! Ask someone. Ask anyone.</p>
