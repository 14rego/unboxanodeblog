<h6>I&rsquo;m trying to be better at saying I love something, only to throw it aside after a while. I try to use it for a few months, then decide if it continues to change the way I do things.</h6>
<p>For the last year or so, I&rsquo;ve been playing with different coding IDEs. I read blogs, I asked around on forums, I talked to my friends, I tried at least six different ones for several weeks. Do you know how many options there are? Everyone thinks that theirs is &ldquo;the real deal&rdquo; and no one should hear otherwise.</p>
<p>Based on the fact that I&rsquo;d been using the Adobe Creative Suite for <em>years</em>, I have always preferred Dreamweaver. But I knew that was the designer in me. Having all of my software work together seamlessly was just too good to question. Until I started using GIT.</p>
<p>This made me question <em>everything</em>. I knew there were other IDEs out there that had version control systems and I was bound to find one. But every time I tried something new and got the hang of it and set up all my FTP and repo settings, I always found something Dreamweaver had that I thought I couldn&rsquo;t live without.</p>
<p>I know you think you knew where I&rsquo;m going with this. I found my perfect IDE with all my desired solutions (GIT, FTP sync, powerful find and replace, code-hinting, code-linting, etc.) wrapped up in one little ball? I didn&rsquo;t. It doesn&rsquo;t exist for someone like me.</p>
<p>I did, however, find a great solution. It wasn&rsquo;t free, unfortunately, but it&rsquo;s not expensive like Dreamweaver. Thanks to my previous years of print designing, I&rsquo;ve always upgraded to the latest Creative Suite and just enjoyed Dreamweaver because of it. But those days are over.</p>
<p>Now, I use <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/" target="_blank">Espresso</a> for Mac. It does everything I need except manage my repos, but I have <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/overview" target="_blank">Sourcetree</a> for that and no one does it better. These two tools have become my rocks. I &ldquo;never leave home without it.&rdquo;</p>
