<p>Today I joined an <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/building-responsive-teams/">Invision webinar about Building Responsive Teams</a> to go with our responsive web experience. What most resonated with me was the concept of daily team stand-ups:</p>

<div class="well">
<p>A standup is a daily meeting where everyone stands in a circle and answers 3 questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What did you do yesterday?</li>
<li>What will you do today?</li>
<li>What impediments are in your way?</li>
</ol>
<p>This meeting should never run longer than 15 minutes. Traditional in agile/scrum methodology, standups can be very limited in who participates and how they participate. Nick argues that cross-functional standups can be much more effective, as the meetings become less about roles and more about the goals of the team.</p>
