<p>A friend of mine, <a href="http://twitter.com/jeremyalan" target="_blank">@jeremyalan</a>, always has my best interests in mind. If not for him and his overly complimentary, highly biased, and largely insane confidence in me, I wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly the &ldquo;developer&rdquo; I am today. In fact, I&rsquo;m not sure that without his efforts, I&rsquo;d feel comfortable calling myself a developer at all. Regardless&hellip;</p>

<p>My point is &mdash; he got me a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a>! I mean, I&rsquo;m not sure what level nerd he thinks I am, but I&rsquo;m 98% sure that the easiest thing for me to do will be to create a case for it to live in&hellip; beyond that &mdash; lord, help us all. This is going to be an adventure. But don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m up for it. Let the fun begin.</p>
