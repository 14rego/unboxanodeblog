<p>Recently, I’ve been trying to add touch support to a checklist I’ve been working on. I was already using jQuery .draggable() and .droppable() for desktop users, but mobile/tablet users had to open each item to change the status.</p>

<p>My first instinct was the jQuery Mobile library, but even without the CSS, all I really needed was a new set of javascript events. A friend of mine suggested <a href="http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js/" target="_blank">Hammer.js</a>, so I began looking into it yesterday. I ran into my first problem while trying to bind the events to elements added to the DOM by an .ajax() function. Although I think I eventually could’ve figured it out, Hammer was making it so hard to work with (event propagation and sibling/relationship problems), I decided to try something else.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://jgestures.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">jGestures.js</a> - a suggestion from a fellow developer that was also having Hammer issues. jGestures was easy to use: instead of entering options for each event (as long as that’s not exactly what you need), you simply bound to one of the easy custom events, and away you went with your function. There were many less parent-child problems, as long as you designated the .bind() within the .ajax() success function. And I loved the easy-to-use events, like swipetwo [swipe with two fingers], swiperight [swipe toward right only, regardless of distance].</p>

<p>The swipetwo event was especially useful as I’ve heard a lot of problems with a device differentiating between scrolling and swiping or dragging objects. I loved it and I’m sure you will, too. Very happy with my new gesture support.</p>
