<p>In the beginning of time&hellip; just kidding, the beginning of October, really&hellip; I was tasked with a new web app. I had two days to get something up and running. I thought it was crazy. But I used some old code and examples and pulled something together (nevermind the insane amounts of technical debt I found along the way).</p>
<p>One month later, I have an amazing app. It&rsquo;s live and amazing and my new baby. I love it and I&rsquo;m ever-so proud of it. It even has users. Users that haven&rsquo;t had one complaint. I call that successful, no?</p>
