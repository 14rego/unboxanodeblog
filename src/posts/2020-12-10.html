<p>I'd love to be able to blame it on COVID, but really I have no excuse. It's been a very, very, very long time since I made any attempt at blogging on my website. Mostly my excuse is that I was between website stacks and hadn't taken the time to work out the API properly yet.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, that still hasn't happened. But I did get tired of my old setup not working and decided to just use a static site generator for this bit.</p>

<blockquote>Call it the curse of being a modern developer? You just perpetually learn new things and want to try whatever's the flavor of the week and see if it holds up.</blockquote>

<p>I do have more plans, but - for now - please enjoy a surprisingly hilarious look into my journey as a designer and developer back when I actually wrote blog posts.</p>
