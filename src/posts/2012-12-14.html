<p>In case you are unfamiliar, the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.number-format.php" target="_blank">number_format() function</a> in PHP, with a little help in formatting settings, can format your numbers to display commas and decimal points however you see fit. For example, 1000.316 can very easily become $1,000.32 with little-to-no effort.</p>

<p>My first problem with this came while using Chrome input tags of the &lsquo;number&rsquo; type. I was pulling info from a a database, formatting it very nicely, then displaying it in the inputs. But in Chrome, a number input will not accept commas, so it simply wasn&rsquo;t displaying any data at all.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m all for making a browser friendly and easy to use, but Chrome adding these extra input features is a little bit annoying. Not to mention, on the date-type inputs, it has a native datepicker - which you have to disable if you already employ them so that you don&rsquo;t have two pop up at once. I just feel like maybe there should be another html tag for an input that you&rsquo;d like additional, native options. Maybe a datepicker type? Something.</p>

<h6>Side note: some things I can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t know before: jQuery&rsquo;s .trigger() - clearly this saved me A LOT of time.</h6>

<h6>And the cache settings in .ajax() - here I have been hating IE this whole time and now... well, I still hate it, but thanks to ajax&rsquo;s cache settings, I don&rsquo;t have much to worry about.</h6>
