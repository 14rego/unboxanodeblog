<p>Depending on how personally you know me, you may or may not know that I’ve started a new gig. I’m a contract-to-hire front-end developer at a pharmaceutical marketing agency.</p>
<p>It’s not terribly far-off from what I was doing before, but pretty different for me to concentrate on front-end only and not have to worry about database and back-end maintenance.</p>
<p>That said, I’m settling in nicely and very much enjoying making new friends and meeting other developers!</p>
