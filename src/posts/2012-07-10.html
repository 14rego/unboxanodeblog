<p>One of the reasons that I was hired on at <a href="http://softekinc.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Softek</a> was because we are a technology company - a healthcare software company. But, as of 2010, our website consisted of .jpg images and inline, absolutely-positioned divs and tables in html.</p>

<p>This <b>cannot happen</b>, people. How is it that, in 2012, I can go to a website of a fantastic software company (full of geeks and nerds) and their website looks like a teenager built it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Geocities</a>?</p>

<p>I’m aware that companies are scared of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CMS</a>. Although fantastic for companies that don’t employ nerds to run it, companies are afraid that a templated site will make it looked "canned" and unoriginal, but seriously - instead you chose to hire someone to custom-build you <i>that</i>?! Such a shame. I don’t understand.</p>
