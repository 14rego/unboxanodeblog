<p>We&rsquo;re going to add a few infographics to our Softek site, so I decided to go out and see how everyone was feeling about the impact of infographics to date. I&rsquo;ve seen hundreds of them and I tend to like them, but what do other people think?</p>
<p>I came across this infographic on Google+: <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/wa/rathat/infographic.html" target="_blank">Why Infographics Suck</a>.</p>
<p>Not a terrible illustration, by any means, but I don&rsquo;t understand the point. A lot of people mention they don&rsquo;t like them because it&rsquo;s a fancy attempt at displaying boring information in an interesting way. Maybe it is.</p>
<p>Designers think it&rsquo;s cluttered and just "done all wrong", in terms of colors and fonts. I can understand this argument, but not everyone can come up with the same ideas and designs or the world would be a very boring place.</p><p><i>Of course</i> people want better SEO - they want more people to find their site. <i>So what</i> if it has a lot of graphics! If having a lot of graphics on the web is a problem, someone should probably tell <a href="http://pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>, <a href="http://gettyimages.com/" target="_blank">Getty</a>, <a href="http://shutterstock.com/" target="_blank">Shutterstock</a>, <a href="http://istockphoto.com/" target="_blank">iStockPhoto</a>, <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" target="_blank">Picasa</a>, etc.</p><p>Just sayin&rsquo;.</p>
