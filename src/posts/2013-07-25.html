<p>I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://fancybox.net" target="_blank">FancyBox</a> so long that I hadn&rsquo;t even realized there were better things out there! Then I found <a href="http://bootboxjs.com" target="_blank">Bootbox</a>. I won&rsquo;t pretend it&rsquo;s the only or even the best option when it comes to a jQuery lightbox solution, but I will say I love it.</p>
<p>The markup is easy and simple. It has tons of features. Best of all, I don&rsquo;t feel like I have to worry about it. It works. Every. Time. It&rsquo;s too easy not to use.</p>
