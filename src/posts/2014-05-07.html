<p>I frequently find that knowing a lot of different languages and processes is to your detriment if you don&rsquo;t actively engage in practicing at least once a week. It becomes increasingly difficult to remember the small differences over time. I might need to set a reminder to get a &lsquo;refresher course&rsquo; every couple of weeks to stay up-to-date. Sad, I know.</p>
