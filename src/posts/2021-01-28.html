intro: "Remember GreenSock from back in the day? I almost didn't either."
---
<p>Y&rsquo;all, <a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3" target="_blank">GreenSock</a> is still kicking! I used to use GreenSock, like, decades ago when animation started making its way out of Flash. GreenSock was great then because it was lightweight (remember dial-up?!) and the scripting was a lot like ActionScript.</p>

<p>And now, today, I&rsquo;m re-exporing GreenSock and it&rsquo;s seemingly countless plug-ins and features for a complicated animation I&rsquo;m putting together at work. For this one, I&rsquo;m using the Timeline feature (classic), a newer plugin called ScrollTrigger, and another plug-in called ScrollToPlugin that is pretty minimal.</p>

<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p><a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline" target="_blank">Timeline</a>&rsquo;s best feature - to me - has always been [the availability of] simplicity. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it can get very complicated, but you create a timeline object, you place tweens on it, and then you traverse it. It&rsquo;s animation basics and Timeline is all over it. Back in the day, they also had Timeline Lite, which was an even lighter version for the simplest of animations.</p>

<h3>ScrollTrigger</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger" target="_blank">ScrollTrigger</a> plugin is for watching the user&rsquo;s scroll position and triggering animations based on that position.</p>

<p>It has one really cool feature which it seems I can&rsquo;t live without for this particular project - it&rsquo;s called pinning. With pinning, ScrollTrigger creates padding above and below your animation to give additional room for scrolling so that it can "pin" your animation to your viewing frame. So basically the page appears to have stopped scrolling (whizzing by), but now the action of you scrolling is controlling your animation instead. Very clever.</p>

<blockquote>I can only imagine this was developed a couple of years ago when <a href="https://www.wix.com/blog/2019/08/what-is-parallax-scrolling-explained-with-examples" target="_blank">parallax</a>-y web design and development was all the rage and scrolling became more than a way to reach the bottom of the page.</blockquote>

<h3>ScrollToPlugin</h3>
<p>I actually won&rsquo;t end up using <a href="https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollToPlugin" target="_blank">ScrollToPlugin</a>, it turns out. It&rsquo;s a quick way of marrying your timeline with the javascript <code>scrollTo()</code> function, which typically finds an object on the page, getting it&rsquo;s position, and then smoothly scrolling animatedly (is that a word?) to the position.</p>

<p>The reason that&rsquo;s not useful for me on this project is because my positions are so complicated (thanks to ScrollTrigger), that scrolling the page up and down to a position just isn&rsquo;t going to cut it. I need horizontal positioning and such, too, which it doesn&rsquo;t seem to currently offer. Which is fine. It&rsquo;s fine.</p>

<p>All of that to say&hellip; if you&rsquo;re doing any HTML/JS animations in the near future, GSAP is <em>somehow</em> still where it&rsquo;s at.</p>
