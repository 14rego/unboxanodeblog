<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to be a little more social about my hobbies. I keep reminding myself that it&rsquo;s good to meet new people and find new people that I have things on common with.</p>

<p>Some events and groups are more helpful than others, but I&rsquo;m proud to be a member of <a href="http://kcwomenintech.org/">KC Women in Technology</a>. While I&rsquo;m not the best member - nor do I show up to things as often as I should - what this group os doing for women in tech is a great thing.</p>

<p>Maybe you know someone who could benefit? Let us know!</p>
