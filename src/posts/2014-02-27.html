<p>I&rsquo;ve been hearing quite a lot about <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com" target="_blank" rel="no-follow">Foundation (a front-end framework)</a> lately. I decided to look into it and see what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<p>As a long-time [in developer years] <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> user, I&rsquo;ve got to say &mdash; I&rsquo;m slightly blown away. Now, I haven&rsquo;t tried it yet, but I can already see a lot of grid features I wish Bootstrap had. I found enough features I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t live without that I&rsquo;m convinced I&rsquo;ll be trying out Foundation for a small project very soon! Stay tuned!</p>
