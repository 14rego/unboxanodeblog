<p>I’ve been hearing quite a lot about <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com" target="_blank" rel="no-follow">Foundation (a front-end framework)</a> lately. I decided to look into it and see what it’s all about.</p>
<p>As a long-time [in developer years] <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a> user, I’ve got to say &mdash; I’m slightly blown away. Now, I haven’t tried it yet, but I can already see a lot of grid features I wish Bootstrap had. I found enough features I felt like I couldn’t live without that I’m convinced I’ll be trying out Foundation for a small project very soon! Stay tuned!</p>
