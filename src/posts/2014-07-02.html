<p>New toys are always fun. <a href="http://www.restivejs.com/" target="_blank">Restive.js</a> is a fantastic new toy for web developers who are looking for a new tool for their responsive or adaptive styling toolbox.</p>
<p>To cut to the chase, Restive allows you to &ldquo;sniff out&rdquo; devices and breakpoints simply and [almost too] easily. Four quick lines of javascript can ease breakpoint headaches web developers have been suffering from for years!</p>
<p>I’ve actually used it on several sites so far and I can’t see myself looking back any time soon. Give it a try for your next project.</p>
