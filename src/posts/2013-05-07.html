<p>Topics discussed included signals, or red flags, that cause you to stop and investigate what could be considered &ldquo;bad&rdquo; code.</p>

<p><b>Feature Envy</b> &mdash; when objects and methods are organized poorly, several things will happen. Objects return results from another object. You might look for a magnet for code changes that don’t really apply to this class or object. Or a one-line function returning lots of different things. An object’s functionality should be fully encapsulated.</p>
