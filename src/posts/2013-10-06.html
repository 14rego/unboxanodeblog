<p>Ever since I started developing, I&rsquo;ve learned so much. I learn so much every. Single. Day. I know people say this all the time, but I really mean it.</p>
<p>I can design or develop something one day, then come back <em>not even three weeks later</em> and be <em>astounded</em> that I ever wrote code like that or solved a problem that way.</p>
<p>Guess it&rsquo;s true what they say about progress. Unfortunately, it also causes me to re-write perfectly good code over and over and over.</p>
<h6>On a side-note&hellip; one of my older mentors used to always quote a saying that went something like, &ldquo;When you are through changing, you are through.&rdquo; [ &mdash; Bruce Barton ] I always thought there were much better quotes about change, but this still does the trick.</h6>
