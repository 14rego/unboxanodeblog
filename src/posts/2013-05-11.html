<h6>[ Another from the KCDC series&hellip; ] I recently went to the <a href="http://kcdc.info">Kansas City Developer’s Conference</a> where I like to think I learned a lot and I’d like to share some with you.</h6>
<p>Topics discussed included using JSON, jQuery, and AJAX requests to optimize interactive web applications.</p>
