<p>I was talking with a friend today about the designer and developer I&rsquo;ve become since getting my job with <a href="http://softekinc.com" target="_blank">Softek</a> and I realized how much I&rsquo;ve learned, both from working and also just having time to learn, dig and play.</p>

<p>I keep buying e-books to learn more and more things and I never really stop to look back at how far I&rsquo;ve come. By estimate, I think I&rsquo;m at least three times the developer I was two years ago. That&rsquo;s progress.</p>

<p>Now, the big question: have I outgrown another box?</p>
