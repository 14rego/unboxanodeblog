<p>I recently had an issue on my work laptop that I would consider catastrophic. Namely, my entire <code>/usr/local</code> folder was mysteriously, just, <em>gone</em> one day. If anyone is familiar with developing on a Mac, typically with Homebrew (a popular set up), then you know that this means, like, <em>everything</em> was just gone in thin air.</p>

<p>I will say, it can be nice to start with a clean slate sometimes, but I typically like to know before I&rsquo;m making a big change like this so I can back things up and be prepared. This time, I had no choice. Regardless, I did take the opportunity to make some pretty big changes.</p>

<p>Firstly, I switched to ZSH from Bash. While it&rsquo;s wholey unfamiliar, this was as good a time as any. A friend shared their favored dotfile setup and it was <em>really</em> handy for getting everything set up. Leave a comment if you&rsquo;d like to try the same, I&rsquo;d be glad to send a repo link.</p>

<p>Secondly, I&rsquo;m trying a new localhost setup where I can set up various different virtual hosts and - compared to what I had been doing before - it&rsquo;s <em>life-changing</em>. I wish I&rsquo;d have set things up like this a long time ago. It combines two different popular techniques for the optimal setup. Again, let me know if you&rsquo;d like more detail. Have I got a set of commands for you. Ha.</p>

<p>Mostly I just wanted to share that things are getting really streamlined and all the squeeky wheels are getting greased around here. I should make a back up now while I can&hellip;</p>
