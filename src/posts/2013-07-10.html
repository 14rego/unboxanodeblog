<p>Three words: <b>I love it</b>.</p>
<p>I’ve been working with it for a while now for a couple of projects and I love how easy it is. I’ve unknowingly created similar grid systems and this is just perfect. I like the responsive additions the best. I love not having to worry about the small stuff - just design and go. Wonderful.</p>
