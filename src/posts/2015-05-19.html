<p>I recently found out about <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=viewport-units">CSS Viewport Units</a>. It would be fantastic to use these units to make things like an easy 960 grid.</p>
<p>I feel like I’d heard of it before, but was discouraged by the browser support. Looking at it again, I’m a little more optimistic, but those are some crazy &ldquo;known issues&rdquo;! <i>&ldquo;iOS 7 Safari sets viewport unit values to 0 if the page has been left and is returned to after 60 seconds.&rdquo; &ldquo;iOS 7 Safari recalculates widths set in vh as vw, and heights set in vw as vh, when orientation changes.&rdquo;</i> After looking at the support list, I was *most* excited to use this in iOS. Not anymore.</p>
