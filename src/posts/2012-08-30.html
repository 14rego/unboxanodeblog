<p>So, someone came to me the other day rather perplexed. They had asked their designer for .ico files of their logo, but hadn’t specified that they would be using them as Windows filder icons, not a browser favicon. I realized that I had never made OS folder icons, either, so I started digging. Turns out, Photoshop really doesn’t do you a lot of good. Neither does using a Mac, as most converter programs are for PCs only.</p>
