<h6>[ Another from the KCDC series&hellip; ] I recently went to the <a href="http://kcdc.info">Kansas City Developer&rsquo;s Conference</a> where I like to think I learned a lot and I&rsquo;d like to share some with you.</h6>
<p>Topics discussed included <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/" target="_blank">the 10 UI Heuristics</a>, using human psychology to think about interface design.</p>
<h2>What I found most interesting:</h2>
<p>Even better than customized error messages &mdash; prevent the user from making the error. Give them every possible chance to make the right choices. Minimize all of the probably wrong answers and give extra instruction for things that are more complicated. If they still make a mistake, express the problem in plain English and suggest a helpful solution.</p>
