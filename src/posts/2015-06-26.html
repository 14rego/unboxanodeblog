<p>Following are my take-aways from the 2015 <a href="http://kcdc.info">Kansas City Developers Conference</a></p>

<h5>Build and API in Node in under 30 mins</h5>
<h6>Jordan Kasper</h6>
<p>I was hoping for more of an emphasis on &ldquo;You can do it in 30 minutes because you just don&rsquo;t know how simple it really is.&rdquo; Instead of&hellip; &ldquo;I work at this company that makes this tool that turns this complicated thing into something that you can do in a short amount of time - and, of course - I&rsquo;m going to do it as fast as possible to be sure it&rsquo;s in under 30 minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was great to see a tool being used by someone who knows the &ldquo;ins and outs&ldquo; of the tool, if for no other reason. Cool tool, sure. I&rsquo;m not sold that easily.</p>

<h5>Overcoming Chartophobia</h5>
<h6>Meagan Longoria</h6>
<p>While I was hoping for lots of examples showing great alternatives for complicated tables full of data, what I took away instead were lots of great variables and questions to ask about data that can weed out the information you don&rsquo;t need and emphasize the more important parts. I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not in the business of data visualization.</p>

<h5>Ionic SDK</h5>
<h6>Jeremy Mason and Josh Durham</h6>
<p>Unfortunately for me, I&rsquo;ve seen these guys do this talk before, but I very much believe in what they preach. They should just work for Ionic so they can go show people how cool it is. Or, I suppose, this session holds more weight in other people&rsquo;s minds because they don&rsquo;t. Food for thought&hellip;</p>

<h5>Intro to Hacking with Raspberry Pi</h5>
<h6>Sarah Withee</h6>
<p>This week, Sarah made hundreds of developers feel the feelings they&rsquo;ve all been avoiding. We all have a Raspberry Pi at home that we hooked up as a web server, stuck in a corner, and haven&rsquo;t touched ever again. I have two.</p>
<p>The difference is - Sarah planted little seeds in everyone&rsquo;s mind with little ideas of what they should go home and try. I wish I had enough spare cash to buy a bunch of fun toys to feed my hobby, but none-the-less.</p>

<!--h5>Gulp and Slush</h5>
<h6>Jesse Harlin</h6>
<p></p>

<h5>JavaScript in Detail</h5>
<h6>Joe Andaverde</h6>
<p></p>

<h5>Leveraging Modern Device Features from the Web</h5>
<h6>Andrew Dunkman</h6>
<p></p>

<h5>JavaScript Testing</h5>
<h6>Jennifer Wadella</h6>
<p></p>

<h5>Specialists &amp; Generalists</h5>
<h6>Heather Wilde</h6>
<p></p>

<h5>The Impact of Leveraging Open Source</h5>
<h6>Jeff Strauss</h6>
<p></p-->

<p>I <i>will eventually</i> finish this post&hellip; soon.</p>

<p><b>TLDR: While every session left me with something I was not expecting, they were still not what I was expecting. Regardless, I got my money&rsquo;s worth. Also, I follow a <i>lot</i> more people on <a href="http://twitter.com/artsy_nerdsy">Twitter</a>.</b></p>
