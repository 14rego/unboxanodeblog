intro: 'JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN do something over-the-top, new, probably wonderful to someone, and perplexing - does NOT mean you should.'

<p>I’ve had this conversation, mostly with graphic and UI designers, several times: JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN do something over-the-top, new, probably wonderful to someone, and perplexing - does NOT mean you should. For this reason, I will likely be changing my current footer to a regular, &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; footer later today. I hate how mobile unfriendly it is. Yes, I might create a conditional stylesheet, but I’ll probably just drop the whole thing. Too bad, too - it was cool.</p>
