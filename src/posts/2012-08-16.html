<p>I had some free time on my hands (and a little extra cash), so I bought some e-books on various web design and development subjects from one of my favorite industry resources, <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/ebooks/" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a>. I was most excited to try a beginners guide to Ruby.</p>
<p>Going into it, I thought this was going to be my first experience with an object-oriented language, as I had been told - but it turns out - I’ve been using object-oriented code for years and didn’t even know it. I flew through the first six chapters and made a nifty, little Ruby-only interactive game sort of like Wolf. (Imagine being in a room full of doors and moving room to room as you wish, coming upon different surroundings.)</p>
<p>But interestingly enough, after I finished my first successful Ruby script, without even getting into Rails, I felt done with Ruby. I learned a lot about Ruby and a whole lot about how OOP should work, but after reading a blog post about how a lot of languages can work just as well, I sort of abandoned the whole thing and haven’t looked back.</p>
<p>(Also, it required a lot of setup of servers and such that I just don’t seem to have the time for. If you do, you should try it, for real.)</p>
