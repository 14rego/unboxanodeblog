<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been challenged to create a chat widget-type panel for an HMTL site. Not exactly sure how to tackle it, but looking forward to figuring it out. Apache available if I need it, but hopefully not. It&rsquo;s interesting to me - the different ways available to solve problems like this. Reminds me of a &ldquo;polyglot development with <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a> reverse proxies&rdquo; session I attended at <a href="http://kcdc.info" target="_blank">KCDC</a> last year by <a href="http://twitter.com/adunkman" target="_blank">@ADunkman</a>. You never know when you will need to know or use this stuff, folks. Should be an interesting weekend&hellip;</p>
