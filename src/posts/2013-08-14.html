<p>OK, I&rsquo;m not gonna lie &mdash; I&rsquo;m very wary and skeptical of HTML5, CSS3, and pretty much any jQuery solution. I&rsquo;ve been practicing jQuery-less code for years, avoiding the odd-job user who, for some reason, turned it off or was using IE6. But it&rsquo;s time to step up. Webkit is taking over. (THANK YOU, BABY JESUS - AM I RIGHT?!)</p>
<p>These days, I can just insert a little HTML right inline with my text, and I have beautiful, wonderful, responsive icons and symbols. Thank you, <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>! I never thought I would love skipping the whole icon-editing process, but I do. I really, really do.</p>
<p>Now, all I need to do is petition for some more icons I haven&rsquo;t seen developed, yet&hellip;</p>
