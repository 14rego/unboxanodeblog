<p>I decided my newest app needed a little flair, so I went looking for an easy-to-use loading animation. I almost immediately came upon <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1964839/jquery-please-wait-loading-animation" target="_blank">this StackExchange post</a> with an insanely popular answer by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/54680/jonathan-sampson" target="_blank">Jonathan Sampson</a>. [ <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jonathansampson/VpDUG/170/" target="blank">jsFiddle</a> ] I had it set up in seconds, it works great, and I can&rsquo;t believe the amount of professionalism it adds.</p>

<p>In a word, it&rsquo;s wonderful. Use. Share.</p>
