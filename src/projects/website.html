				<h3>Cutting Edge</h3>
				<p>I can tell you're as excited to hear about all the underlying technology as I am to tell you about it. But there's nothing exceptional about this web site, I'll admit. It's HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit<sup>*</sup> of javascript. And that's the beauty of it to me. What else does it need? Not a thing.</p>
				<p>I've transitioned to using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="nofolow">11ty</a>, which is a static site generator based on Node. I had previously cobbled together a string of build scripts, but this is just too simple to pass up.</p>
				<p>Once the build and compilation is complete, I just serve my HTML files statically on a linux server with Apache mod-rewrite rules for pretty URLs.</p>
				<p>While I have previously created a working blog API for posts and comments, I've decided not to use it because it's just overkill for the amount of traffic I receive. It's a fun project to do, just unnecessary for my needs. Check out the Unboxapi project <a href="/projects/unboxapi">here</a>.</p>
				<p class="small">*Let's be honest, even a "tiny bit" is probably overkill in terms of user experience. Do things really need to zoom around and have cool effects? Not really.</p>

				<h3>Ain't It Pretty</h3>
				<p>Again, there's nothing particularly exceptional here. I really needed to spend more time developing than designing this site because a redesign was well overdue. Every project has it's priorities and the design for this simply wasn't it. So, I found an open-source design template called "Black" by UICookies and modified it until it was exactly what I needed.</p>
