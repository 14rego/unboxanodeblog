				<h3>Cutting Edge</h3>
				<p>I can tell you're as excited to hear about all the underlying technology as I am to tell you about it. But there's nothing exceptional about this web site, I'll admit. It's HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit<sup>*</sup> of javascript. And that's the beauty of it to me. What else does it need? Not a thing.</p>
				<p>While the final product is just a few HTML files, the build process is a bit more robust than you might expect. While developing locally, I rely on Node to serve my files. I also employ Gulp to do things like compile my CSS from SCSS files, lint, concatenate, and minify my JS, and piece together HTML files I build in a very MVC-sort-of style with global page templates and view partials.</p>
				<p>Once the build and compilation is complete, I just serve my HTML files statically on a linux server with Apache mod-rewrite rules for pretty URLs.</p>
				<p>The blog does, however, rely on an API I created. No way I'm drawing up all 50 of the blog posts in my archive manually. Check out the Unboxapi project <a href="/projects/unboxapi">here</a>.</p>
				<p>Of course, I have plans to rewrite this site in React immediately after "finishing" it.</p>
				<p class="small">*Let's be honest, even a "tiny bit" is probably overkill in terms of user experience. Do things really need to zoom around and have cool effects? Not really.</p>

				<h3>Ain't It Pretty</h3>
				<p>Again, there's nothing particularly exceptional here. I really needed to spend more time developing than designing this site because a redesign was well overdue. Every project has it's priorities and the design for this simply wasn't it. So, I found an open-source design template called "Black" by UICookies and modified it until it was exactly what I needed.</p>
